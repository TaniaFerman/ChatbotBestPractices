\section{Chatbot Purpose}

Designers like Christ should give an specific purpose to the chatbot. So when Laura uses the chatbot for the first time, she will understand what the chatbot was created.

\section{Conversational and situational Knowledge}

In order to have a good conversation the chatbot and the user should share a conversational and situational knowledge.  Conversational knowledge is when Laura should be able to follow the meaning of the chatbot remarks, while the chatbot should be able to select a response that fits coherently into what Laura is saying. Situaltional knowledge is when the chatbot should be situation-aware regarding Lauraâ€™s context.
